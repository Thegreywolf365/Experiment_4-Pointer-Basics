# Experiment_4-Pointer-Basics

## Algorithm:
1. Start
2. assign variable (say a) a value
3. define the pointer variable to be equal to the address of the variable a.
4. Print the address, the value at the address and address of the pointer.
5. Stop

## A.
To use pointers to reference cells and print their values

## B.
An example in which if one value is the same as another cell pointer, the referenced value will theoretically be the where the pointer points.
Practically the computer understands and is not possible.
